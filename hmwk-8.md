## INTRODUCTION

Make a few sketches of the data visualizations that might suit your project, take a photo of those sketches and create a style guide or swatch board (with color palette, fonts, layout indications) in a gist. These can build on your prototype time-series, mapping, or graph visualizations from previous weeks, but should reflect your "ideal" layout and not be limited to what you were able to accomplish in previous weeks. It doesn't have to be as detailed as this one but it should have a few main sections:
- Colors (hex values chosen)
- Fonts
- Template (general layout, with sketches-hand sketched and photographed/embedded in a gist or uploaded somewhere.
- Description of the dataset(s)
- Description of the concept and larger narrative - what aspects of your data will this style highlight?

## ANALYSIS

I have three working concepts for the final project—a full style guide for one of them—but I haven’t made a final decision yet and I would appreciate suggestions!

__1. NYC traffic circumstances that most frequently lead to cyclist injuries__
This concept would look at patterns in cyclist and/or motorist behavior that lead to cyclist injury most frequently (possible examples: left turns, speeding, leaving the bike lane, door-opening, etc...) This project could help inform responsible motorists when to be more alert for cyclists and help cyclists anticipate the most risky types of traffic scenarios (has this been done already? Seems likely...). The [Vision Zero data feed](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/vz_datafeeds.shtml) and NYC Open Data on all [motor vehicle collisions since 2011](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95/data) provide all the necessary information about when, where, and how injuries to cyclists by motor vehicles occur.

__2. Number and type of crimes reported in NYC Parks from 2014-2017__

This project would compare crimes reported within NYC parks, ideally per number of annual visitors and—if I can’t find that data—then per acre. It would be helpful to my thesis project to see how St. Mary’s compares on crime to other parks of similar size/visitorship, both in the Bronx and in the rest of NYC. Because the Park is home base for a large population who are opioid-addicted, I also want to see how many of the reported crimes here involve drugs (compared to other parks). I can use [NYPD crime stats](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/crime-statistics/park-crime-stats.page) for the number of crime complaints per park and the size of each park in square feet. I haven’t yet been able to find an __estimated average number of visitors per park__ or any detailed __reports on park crime__ to specifically find drug crime, but those will be crucial to this concept. NYC Open Data on [park properties](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parks-Properties/rjaj-zgq7/data) has some potentially useful information on all NYC’s parks and will be good to keep on hand.


__3. Who are the ‘St. Mary’s Park community?’__

For my thesis project I’ve conducted a lot of interviews to acquaint myself with the people who live/work/play in and around St. Mary’s Park. I now know who many of them are as individuals, but it is also important to know who they are as a population and how they are similar to or different from NYC as a whole. For this concept I would create a high-level profile of the ‘St. Mary’s Park community,’ which I will represent with [census data](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/86000US10455-10455/) for zip code 10455 (a walkable-sized area surrounding the Park). Key variables will include race/ethnicity, incomes, % below poverty line, persons per household, language, and place of birth.

_Question: how do I approach making statistically-responsible comparisons between these data?)_
