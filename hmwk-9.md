### [Proposal for Final Project](https://github.com/sva-dsi/2017-fall-course/blob/master/syllabus.md#assignment---proposal)

## INTRODUCTION

Consider the data visualization types and tools provided. Determine which type of visualizations you might make with your data, list them, and then select one to test and pursue.

Diagram (aka, discuss in one ¶) what type of visualization you choose for your dataset and what tools you will use to achieve this (include the languages they are written in or the languages you might need to code in).

Keep in mind how this changes or updates your style guide from last week; update that assignment where necessary; and link to the style guide at the end of your proposal.

## ANALYSIS

Last week I proposed a visualization project concept that would use NYC’s Vision Zero data to reveal the driving/cycling scenarios that most frequently lead to cyclist injuries and fatalities in the City. The variables I’d like to include are: accident location, time of day, reason for collision, and other details available (possibly including cyclists’ name). Some possible formats for this data could include:

- Scatterplot
- Bubblechart
- Parallel sets
- Marimekko chart
- Stacked bar
- Radial column chart
- Timeline
- Donut/pie

I still think the geographical portion of this data is pretty important to the concept so I intend to start with Carto to create a dot-map visualization to map the cyclist injuries and fatalities within the past 4 years, perhaps accompanied by a choropleth map that quickly highlights the most dangerous neighborhoods for cyclists. Inspired by _[The Counted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-map-us-police-killings)_ graphic we discussed in class, it would be awesome (although maybe too morbid?) to include stories from the victims and/or photos of their ghostbikes in the case of fatalities.
