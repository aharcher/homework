## INTRODUCTION

_1. Find some geospatial data.
2. Think about the narrative that you might build around it.
3. Write a pitch (< 3 ¶s) explaining your story and linking to the data.
4. Defend your pitch in a few short arguments, describing the format of your data, and what tools/languages you would use to explore and visualize it.
5. Use your practice exercise to defend your pitch with a prototype._

## ANALYSIS

In our Entrepreneurship class, my team and I are developing a service that connects people in NYC who would like to garden but need a plot of land with people who have a highly-coveted backyard space that they don’t actively use. (An easy way to think of the concept is an “Airbnb for backyards.”) In order to gauge the demand for a service like this, we are conducting both end-user research and top down research.

For those New Yorkers who want to expand their gardening hobby beyond the windowsill/fire escape, one of the only other options is registering for a small plot at a local community garden. Community gardens alone do not satisfy the demand for gardening space, however, as their square footage is very small and it generally takes years to get off the waitlists.

Geospatial data from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Open-Space-Parks-/g84h-jbjm) that is quickly and easily [visualized in Carto](https://aharcher.carto.com/builder/9abd5c05-69c1-4a89-afb3-f410b3766c3f/embed) helps us see how few of NYC’s open spaces are designated as community gardens and their respective areas (if you hover over each space). Because the garden spaces are hard to even identify on the map, one can imagine how insufficient they are to the gardening needs of us rent-challenged New Yorkers.

I know there’s potential to make an even stronger argument here... suggestions please!
